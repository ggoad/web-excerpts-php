	This program is rather large, and runs a handlful of sub routines every day. I've included some of the location mapper as an example from it.

<h2>File List</h2>
<ul>
	<li><b>getPlacesByBounds.php</b>: Gets places inside of a rectangle in geo-coordinates.</li>
	<li><b>saveMapperStops.php</b>: Saves the stops that you have just added, and remove extraneous stops that have been removed.</li>
	<li><b>mapFrontEnd.js</b>: This is an except from the front end. It's an exerpt, so it won't load, but you can see business logic in the code, and how it connects to the backend.</li>
</ul>
