Lexi had practiced, so it was a ton of fun, and she did excellent. <br \/>\n<br \/>\nThen, we learned the chords to Jingle Bells. She did excellent on it as well. <br \/>\n<br \/>\nWe made it all the way through the chords, and was able to add a strum. <br \/>\n<br \/>\nI gave her an advanced strum initially, and she ran with it... however, when we added the singing it was confusing for her.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nWe gave her a more strait-forward strum, and were able to make it far into the song with a high accuracy. <br \/>\n<br \/>\nThe chords and strum are in her notebook. If she wants to explore the advanced strum, she can omit beat 3 of the strum written in her notebook.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n<p>If any of this is incorrect, please contact us at:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Email: ggoadmusic@gmail.com<\/li>\r\n<li>Phone: 336-406-1319<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n","altBody":"","attachments":[],"CCs":["ggoadmusic@gmail.com"],"errorMessage":""}
